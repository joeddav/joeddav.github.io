Hi, I'm <strong>Joe</strong>. I'm an AI/ML engineer and researcher focused on LLM reasoning systems: reliable agents, inference scaling, and reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards.
<br>
<br>
I lead AI work at <strong>BambooHR</strong> (shipping the next generation of Ask BambooHR). Previously I was on the <strong>Hugging Face</strong> science team&mdash;you may know my work if you've ever encountered the <a href="https://huggingface.co/tasks/zero-shot-classification" target="_blank">zero-shot classification pipeline</a> or the research guide on <a href="https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/en/perplexity" target="_blank">calulating fixed-length model perplexity</a>. I also had a stint as a Senior ML Scientist at <strong>Enveda Biosciences</strong>, applying Transformers to mass-spec structure prediction for drug discovery.
<br>
<br>
I earned an MS in Data Science from <strong>Harvard</strong>, working with faculty including <a href="https://rush-nlp.com/" target="_blank">Sasha Rush</a> and <a href="https://finale.seas.harvard.edu/" target="_blank">Finale Doshi-Velez</a>, and spent a year in doctoral studies at the <strong>University of Utah</strong> with <a href="https://svivek.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Vivek Srikumar</a>.
<br>
<br>
Work that excites me right now includes RLVR research like <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.24864" target="_blank">ProRL</a> from NVIDIA, the open sourcing of <a href="https://openai.com/index/introducing-gpt-oss/" target="_blank">GPT-OSS</a> weights and <a href="https://cookbook.openai.com/articles/openai-harmony" target=_blank">Harmony</a>, and recent results on <a href="https://epoch.ai/frontiermath" target="_blank">FrontierMath</a> and <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/openai-gold-iom-math-competition-2025-7" target="_blank">IMO</a>.

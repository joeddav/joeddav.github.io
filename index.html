Hi, I'm <strong>Joe</strong>. I'm an AI/ML engineer and researcher focused on reliable reasoning systems: long-horizon agents, evaluation, and real-world deployment.
<br>
<br>
I lead AI work at <strong>BambooHR</strong> (shipping the next generation of Ask BambooHR). Previously I was on the <strong>Hugging Face</strong> science team and a Senior ML Scientist at <strong>Enveda Biosciences</strong>, applying Transformers to mass-spec structure prediction for drug discovery.
<br>
<br>
I earned an MS in Data Science from <strong>Harvard</strong>, working with faculty including <a href="https://rush-nlp.com/" target="_blank">Sasha Rush</a> and <a href="https://finale.seas.harvard.edu/" target="_blank">Finale Doshi-Velez</a>, and spent a year in doctoral studies at the <strong>University of Utah</strong> with <a href="https://svivek.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Vivek Srikumar</a>.
<br>
<br>
Lately I've been focused full-time on the challenge of integrating AI agents into legacy software.
